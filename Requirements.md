##Questions for the costomer are shown as below
1 General set up
..* How many types of payroll in the group? For example, manager, CEO, normal worker, cleaner, Internship stuff...
..* For each type of payroll, what is the base for the calculation of payroll? Annually based, or monthly based, daily based, or hourly based?
..* What is the size of this group?
..* What is the potential size of this group in two decades? (Remark, the development of a company might cause the rapid increase of num of users)

..* What type of accont is company's bank account?



2 The detail question important to the form of software
..* In this company, who has authorization to modify all the setting, and see everyone's situation from a God view? (Remark: The one who has authorization probably is CEO and manager in Financial department, I guess)
..* Which range of people has only the authorization of viewing and some simple setting, but can not see other's situation
..* Does this company alrady has a system to identify everyone's identification? If does, which based? If doesn't, which based do they prefer, in the payroll system to set up identification of users
..* What kind of device they might use? If they want to available in computer and phone, website or App? If app, both available in Apple Store and Android Store?

3 Peripheral System of Software
..* _Scurity_: 
Remark:  Before asking, consider several questions, 
..*1 the potential openting might be attacked, and where does these opening connect to; For this question, only ask what equipment they used, what their network looks like...
..*2 What is potential security bugs do they have in the device, bank account, network form this company used? The question asked is same with above
..* 3 Password: This may not lead to a question, but consider what's the best strategy to have strong password? What's the most secure way for a person find back the lost password? Maybe by texting their phone with confirm code? This may lead the question that which mobile compamy do they use? 

..* _Technology support_
Remark: Meet with their technology office, talk with them to figure out which way do they prefer to protect the system or fix the system, and at same time consider the bottom line of us. Which part of basic setting is good and benifit for both sides when we open the autorization to them? Which part we only want to see by ourselves? And design special user interface for the technology admistritor. At same time, consider after this payroll system is shipped, in which we we can support them? This period, also negotiate a feedback system.
